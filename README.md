# VV-Linux
The current name is a placeholder.

This is my project to learn a few things. For example, how to name a Linux Distro. I currently know very little but by the end I hope this will be a good linux distro that will work on as many ARM64 devices as possible. If you're wondering why ARM64 and not x86, it's because I use a macbook (for school and everything else), and I don't have a computer (other than a macbook) to install linux on. And just like the licence said, do whatever you want with my software, although I discourage selling it, I can't actually make you not sell it.
