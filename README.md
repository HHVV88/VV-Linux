 # Blackcomb Linux

This is my project to learn a few things. For example, how to name a Linux Distro. And just like the licence said, do whatever you want with my software, although I discourage selling it, I can't actually make you not sell it. 

Once I get an ISO here, I request that (once the time comes) you test it as riggerously as possible, I want you to find every problem you can. While again, I cannot force you, do what you want.

Change of plans, I'm gonna make it an x86 operating system first, but I have yet to aquire that x86 macbook pro, so my start date will be pushed back to at the earliest, next Saturday. But you never know, I'm a seventh grader nearing the end of the semester. There's a chance that stuff get's pushed back even more because of homework and summatives (finals for each unit, btw, I'm in the IB MYP), and maybe even Christmas. Also, I'm thinking of starting a youtube series where I document making this linux distro I have dubbed "Blackcomb". If you were wondering, I dubbed thy operating system Blackcomb because of Blackcomb mountain, and project Blackcomb (windows 7).

In recent news, I have decided not to use LFS+BLFS for the sake of my own sanity, I will instead base blackcomb on Fedora. But someday, when the time is right, I will try LFS+BLFS.
In other news, I have made a youtube channel documenting what I'm doing, although nothings there, here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/@Idontmaketutorials

I have decided that I will once again, rest my sanity in the hands of my skill (both with linux and researching) to get to LFS, and then BLFS and I think that it will be a clunky and long road to the day (if it comes) that I release Blackcomb linux as my own.

I will once again be doing this on my M4 macbook, instead of the planned macbook pro from 2018, because I do not have it.
